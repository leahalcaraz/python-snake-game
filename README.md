# python-snake-game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Python using the Pygame library. The Snake moves around the screen, eating fruits to grow longer. If the snake collides with itself, the game resets. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.

Code Highlights:
Pygame Integration: Utilizes the Pygame library for graphical rendering and user input.
Object-Oriented Design: Organized code into classes for Snake and Fruit, enhancing readability and maintainability.
Game Logic: Implements core game mechanics such as updating the snake's position, handling collisions, and rendering the game state.

How to Run:
Install Pygame using pip install pygame.
bash
pip install pygame

Run the Python script.
